The most important key to making a good stir-fry is cutting each ingredient to a uniform size as specified above. Cut the vegetables and set them aside in a bowl. Cut the aromatics as directed and set them aside as well.\n\nMake the Sauce: \nIn a small bowl, combine the sherry (or rice wine), broth, and soy sauce.\n\nPrepare Your Wok Space: \nSet the bowls of vegetables, aromatics, and sauce near your stove. Also, have a very small bowl of water next to the stove.\n\nHeat the Wok: \nTurn on a stove burner, as high as it will go. Set a 14-inch wok over this high heat burner. To determine when the wok is hot enough, start flicking droplets of water from the small bowl into the pan after 30 seconds. As soon as a bead of water evaporates within 1 to 2 seconds of contact, the wok is heated and ready for stir-frying. Do not overheat the wok.\n\nPull Wok off the Heat and Add Oil: \nPull the wok off the heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Pick up the pan and carefully swirl it to coat the bottom and sides. (If the wok smokes wildly the moment you add the oil you\'ve overheated the wok. Remove the wok from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes. When it\'s cool enough to handle carefully remove the oil with paper towels, wash the wok, and start again.)\n\nAdd the Aromatics to the Wok: \nPut the wok back on the heat. Add the garlic and chiles (if using), and stir them for 10 seconds or until fragrant.\n\nAdd the Vegetables: \nPush the garlic up the sides of the wok and add the lettuce (or bok choy, or whatever else you\'re using).\n\nSeason the Vegetables: \nSprinkle the salt and pepper over top.\n\nSet a Timer for 2 Minutes: \nIt\'s helpful for newbie stir-fry cooks to set a timer to give them a rough idea of how long this dish will cook and to learn a sense of rhythm. But your main benchmark should be how the food looks and tastes. From this point on the vegetables will cook for approximately 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.\n\nStir-Fry the Vegetables for 1 Minute: \nStir-fry for 1 minute or until the lettuce or vegetables begin to wilt.\n\nAdd the Sauce: \nPour the sauce mixture around and down the sides of the pan instead of directly into the center (to prevent cooling the pan and lowering the cooking temperature). Stir-fry and toss to coat the lettuce.\n\nCover and Cook: \nCover and cook for 15 seconds.\n\nUncover and Stir-Fry: \nUncover and stir-fry for another 30 to 60 seconds, or until the lettuce is crisp-tender and bright green.',E'Internet',NULL,E'Asian',NULL,FALSE),

Though it may be a little harder to work with than a lard or shortening crust, an all-butter crust is versatile, vegetarian-friendly and full of flake and flavor.

I generally make sure my butter has been chilled for several hours prior to use, and assure that my liquids — the egg, water and apple cider vinegar that my recipe calls for — are also very cold.

Cover and let rest at room temperature for about 14 hours; overnight works well. The starter should have risen and become bubbly.\n\n2) If you\'re using active dry yeast, mix it with the water, then combine with the starter, flour, and salt. If you\'re using instant yeast, there\'s no need to combine it with the water first. Mix and knead everything together—by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle—till you\'ve made a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit rough. Knead for about 5 minutes on speed 2 of a stand mixer\n\n3) Place the dough in a lightly greased medium-size bowl, cover the bowl, and let the dough rise for 3 hours, gently deflating it and turning it over after 1 hour, and then again after 2 hours.\n\n4) Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Divide it into three equal pieces.\n\n5) Shape each piece into a rough, slightly flattened oval, cover with greased plastic wrap, and let them rest for 15 minutes.\n\n6) Working with one piece of dough at a time, fold the dough in half lengthwise, and seal the edges with the heel of your hand. Flatten it slightly, and fold and seal again.\n\n7) With the seam-side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 15" log. Place the logs seam-side down into the wells of a baguette pan; or onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined sheet pan or pans.*\n\n8) Cover them with a cover or lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the loaves to rise till they\'ve become very puffy, about 1 1/2 hours.\n\n9) Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 450°F; if you\'re using a baking stone, place it on the lowest rack.\n\n10) Using a very sharp knife held at about a 45° angle, make three 8" vertical slashes in each baguette. Spritz the baguettes heavily with warm water; this will help them develop a crackly-crisp crust.\n\n11) Bake the baguettes until they\'re a very deep golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove them from the oven and cool on a rack. Or, for the very crispiest baguettes, turn off the oven, crack it open about 2", and allow the baguettes to cool in the oven.\n\nYield: Three 16" baguettes.',E'King Arthur Flour',NULL,E'French',NULL,FALSE),

Set a timer for 15 minutes and go do something else. When timer goes off, come back and look at the pear halves. If they have turned slightly brown, add 1/16 teaspoon powdered ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to the ingredients. If you think they have turned really brown, add 1/8 teaspoon ascorbic acid to ingredients. Don\'t overdo it! \n\nBoil the water and dissolve the sugar into it thoroughly. \n\nWash, destem and core the pears, being sure to remove all seeds. Chop roughly and put in nylon straining bag with the chopped raisins. Tie bag and put in primary.

Cover with muslin once again. \n\nStir daily, squeezing bag gently to extract flavor. \n\nWhen vigorous fermentation subsides (about 7 days), remove bag and let drip drain one hour. Do not squeeze or wine will be very difficult to clear. Taste the drained juice. You should taste both acid and tannin.

Stir until sugar is dissolved completely and then sprinkle a packet of yeast onto the liquid. Do not stir. The yeast may float or sink. It makes no difference, but it is easier to check the viability of yeast that float.\n\n*Preservative free juice means juice that does not contain sorbate or sorbic acid or benzoate or benzoic acid in the ingredients listed on the label. Sufites and/or ascorbic acid are okay.\n\n**A pinch is just that. Reach into the container of yeast nutrient and pinch a small amount of nutrient between your thumb and forefinger. That amount is sufficient.\n\nCover the mason jar with a piece of clean linen, paper napkin or paper towel secured with a rubber band. You want air to pass through the covering but want to stop airborne mold, bacteria or dust from entering the jar.\n\nSet a timer for 2 hours and when it rings look at the starter solution. If the yeast are viable, the grains of yeast will have expanded to about twice their original size and turned a light yellowish-gray or yellowish-brown -- similar to the color of Dijon mustard. If not, all the grains of yeast will look exactly as they originally did -- slightly larger perhaps because they absorbed water, but their color will be the same.\n\nIf they are not viable, throw them out and start over with another yeast or simply add another packet of yeast to the solution and wait another 2 hours to see if these are viable.\n\nAssuming the yeast are viable, add 1/4 cup of preservative free white grape juice, apple juice or pulp-free orange juice, 1/4 teaspoon of sugar and a pinch of yeast nutrient. Stir until the sugar is dissolved completely, cover the jar again and reset the timer.\n\nYou repeat this procedure every two hours to keep feeding the yeast. You could use water instead of fruit juice, but fruit juice is better because it contains acid, additional nutrients and sugar. Pouring the juice into the starter and stirring to dissolve the sugar puts oxygen in the solution and yeast need oxygen to reproduce. The pouring and stirring every 2 hours recharges the oxygen and keeps the yeast happy. Happy yeast are a good thing.\n\nWhen you add 1/4 cup of juice every 2 hours the volume increases. We start with a 1-quart jar because at 24 hours we have 6 1/4 cups (a tad over 3 pints) of starter solution to add to the must. The jar will be just over 3/4 full and that extra airspace above the solution is an oxygen source for the yeast.\n\nExcept for watermelon or melon wines, it is a good practice to add the juice from your must at the 16th, 18th, 20th and 22nd hours. In total, you are only adding 1 cup (1/2 pint) of the must to the starter solution, but that acclimates the yeast to the environment you\'ll be adding them to later. This is only 1/3 of the starter solution\'s total volume, but usually sufficient. If the must is vastly different than the juice used in the starter solution, you might start adding juice from the must earlier -- say at the 8th hour. I do this for mustang and several other wild grapes, starfruit, pineapple, blueberry, and berries from extreme northern latitudes (e.g. Newfoundland, Scandinavia). If the must-juice being added has been sulfited, so much the better, as it allows the yeast to become accustomed to sulfites and eliminates any potential shock later.\n\nWhen you use a starter solution you always know your yeast is viable, the quantity of yeast you are adding to the must is several thousand times more than if you just sprinkled a packet of yeast to the must, and you can expect an almost immediate fermentation of your must. It may take another day for a truly vigorous fermentation to develop, but that is much quicker than the 2 or 3 days it usually takes.',E'Jack keller',NULL,NULL,E'0',FALSE),
